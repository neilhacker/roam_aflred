# roam_aflred

Type rperson into alfred and whatever text you enter after will be copied to the top of your clipboard and have double brackets added. Roam will then be opened/move to front of your window and you can them simply cmd v the query straight into it.

Type rbook and the same thing happens but the query is formatted to how I index books.
